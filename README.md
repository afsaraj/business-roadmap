## 📍 Phase 1: Business Clarity – Discovering Your Fit

### 🧠 Understand This First
- A business solves a real-world problem for someone — consistently.
- You don’t need to invent something — start with services, brokering, or content.
- Think: Problem → Offer → Person → Payment → Delivery

### 🔍 Self Discovery Prompts
- What do you already know or love doing?
- What do people ask you for?
- What could you help someone with — today — and possibly charge for?

### 💡 Micro-Exercises
- List 10 services or ideas you could offer, even with help
- Identify people doing simple businesses in your niche (on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn)
